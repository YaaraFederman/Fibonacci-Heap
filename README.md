# Fibonacci-Heap
Fibonacci Heap -  data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees.
This project was programmed as part of my university studies (data structure course) at Tel Aviv University.
The implementation supports functions such as Insert, Decrease Key, Delete Min etc.
